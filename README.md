 **[[General Rules]]**

**Do Not Cheat**

Anything that gives you a advantage over other players is not allowed. This includes, but is not limited to: money cheat, god mode cheat, air break, and tons of others. Simple single player mods such as vehicle mods, house mods, and skins are allowed. If you are not sure of something just ask.      

**Do Not Spam**

Spamming the forums, or in-game chat is not allowed and will result in a mute.     

**Advertising is not Allowed**

This is one of those things that will earn you a ban quickly, so don't do it. However, talking about other servers is allowed ONLY in PM's. However, sharing of IP's is not allowed at all. TL;DR: Don't mention other servers unless in private messages.      

**Do not drive-by at spawn (or spawnkill)**

If you are drivebying at spawn you are not giving people a chance to spawn so don't do it.      

**Respect Everyone.**

If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything.      

**Don't use water truck or fire truck at spawn)** 

That means don't use the water spray to annoy players. Because you don't let them to spawn   

**VIP RULES** 

VIP's must follow all rules, but most importantly they must not abuse the extra features given to them. (Example: killing with the Jetpack is not cool because other players cannot spawn a jetpack).
